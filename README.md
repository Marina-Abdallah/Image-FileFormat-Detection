# Image-FileFormat-Detection
This Java-based application is designed to detect the type of an image file by reading its header data. It supports a variety of image formats, including RAW (CR2), BMP, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, and GIF. The program examines the first few bytes of the file to determine the format and then prints the file type.
